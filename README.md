# Cricket-world-cup-Dashboard
Overview
The Dynamic Cricket Performance Analytics Dashboard is an advanced Power BI-based solution designed to analyze and visualize cricket player performance across five key roles. This dashboard provides actionable insights that can aid in team selection, role optimization, and performance trend tracking throughout a tournament.

Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a Power BI dashboard that:

Analyzes player performance across five critical roles: Openers, Middle Order Specialists, All-Rounders, Finishers, and Fast Bowlers.
Delivers key performance metrics such as strike rate, batting average, boundary percentage, and role-specific efficiency.
Tracks player consistency and offers strategic insights to facilitate data-driven decision-making in team selection.
Key Features
Role-Based Player Performance Analysis
Comprehensive analysis of player performance in five key roles:
Openers
Middle Order Specialists
All-Rounders
Finishers
Fast Bowlers
Advanced Metrics & Visualizations
Performance trends across individual matches
Correlation between strike rate and batting average

Tools & Technologies
Microsoft Power BI: Used for creating interactive visualizations and comprehensive dashboards.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Utilized for advanced data calculations and performance metrics.
Custom Visuals: Enhances the interactivity and engagement of the dashboard.
Data Modeling: Power BI’s data model was applied to structure and relate data for deeper insights.
Insights
The dashboard provides valuable insights for optimizing team performance and strategy, including:

Optimizing Team Selection: Performance metrics across various roles help inform data-driven decisions about team composition.
Tracking Performance Trends: Monitor individual player performance across different matches and tournament stages.
Role-Specific Efficiency: Assess player efficiency based on their designated role (e.g., openers, finishers, bowlers).
Tournament-Specific Analysis: Filters allow for detailed analysis of player performance at various stages, such as Qualifiers or Super 12.
Key Findings:
Players in certain roles (e.g., openers) exhibit more consistent performance than others.
Strike rate and batting average are crucial metrics when selecting players for pivotal roles.
The player comparison matrix enables direct comparison between top performers (e.g., Jos Buttler vs. Alex Hales).
